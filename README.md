# Walmart-DataAnalysis-Using-SQL

ABOUT PROJECT
This project intends to investigate Walmart sales data in order to better understand top performing branches and items, sales trends for various categories, and consumer behavior. The goal is to investigate how sales techniques may be enhanced and maximized. The data was gathered through the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

"In this recruitment challenge, job hopefuls are given historical sales data for 45 Walmart shops situated in various locations. Each business has several sections, and players must forecast sales for each of them. To add to the challenge, the dataset includes chosen holiday markdown events. These markdowns are known to have an influence on sales, but it is difficult to forecast which departments will be affected and to what amount.
